**This project is a C-based menu-driven program designed to perform basic file handling operations such as creating a file, writing to a file (with overwrite), appending content, and reading file data. It is developed using the C programming language and can be compiled with any standard C compiler such as GCC (on Linux or Windows), Turbo C++ (commonly used in academic setups), or Microsoftâ€™s Visual Studio (on Windows). The code can be written and run using editors like Code::Blocks, Dev-C++, Visual Studio Code, Notepad++, or even classic Turbo C++, making it flexible across platforms. The program begins by asking the user for a file name and then presents a simple menu that repeats until the user exits. It supports multi-line input, ending when the user types # on a new line, making it user-friendly and intuitive. This project is ideal for students learning the fundamentals of file I/O in C, especially those exploring how real-world applications manage persistent data. It has educational value in demonstrating how to safely handle input and output using file pointers (FILE *), and how to use file modes such as "r", "w", and "a" effectively. The program is cross-platform and runs on Windows, Linux, or macOS with minimal changes. It also illustrates how loop structures, conditional branching with switch-case, and error handling work in a real application. This tool can be extended or integrated into larger systems for logging, data storage, or simple configuration file management, making it both a practical utility and a valuable learning resource.**
